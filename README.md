These Python files solve the puzzles for days 1-4 and 6 of Advent of Code 2020 - see https://www.adventofcode.com/2020/.
Each day's puzzle has two parts, using the same input.
Every user receives a unique input file, which can be solved using the code here (make sure to replace the file name in the first line of code with your input file).
The code parses and processes the input based on the puzzle instructions on the site and returns the answer to the puzzle.
Feedback is welcome! 
Enjoy
