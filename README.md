<h1 align="center">Welcome to Advent-of-Code 👋</h1>
<p>
</p>

> These Python files solve the puzzles for days 1-4 and 6 of Advent of Code 2020. Each day's puzzle has two parts, which can be solved using the code here.
Every user receives a unique input file for each puzzle. The code processes the input based on the puzzle instructions on the site and returns the answer to the puzzle.
In the first line of code, make sure to replace the file name with your input file.
Feedback is welcome! 
Enjoy :)
